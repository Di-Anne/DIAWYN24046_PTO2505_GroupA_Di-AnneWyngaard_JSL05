# JSL Portfolio Piece: Kanban App Deployment & Features Implementation

## 💡 Overview

Kanban board is a task management app which helps users manage their daily tasks. Each task is represented as a "card" on the board which holds details about that task i.e. title, description, status and priority. The board is divided into three columns that represent stages of the users workflow i.e ('todo', 'doing' and 'done'). The tasks are also divided into three levels of priority represented by a colored dot (red = high priority, orange = medium priority, green = low priority). Tasks are arranged from highest to lowest priority with the highest positioned to the top of the status column. This gives the user a quick visual overview of where all work stands.

## ✨ Features

- **✅ Task Editing:** Click on task cards to edit details (title, description, status column, priority) and save changes.
- **❌ Task Deletion:** Click on task to delete a task via 'Delete Task' button. Confirmation message for deletion will appear to prevent accidental deletions
- **🔍 Filtering & Sorting:** Advanced options to quickly prioritize and organize tasks based on color of priority for easy visaul representation of important and non-important tasks.
- **👀 Sidebar Interaction:** Sidebar is toggleable between visible and hidden using hidden icon (hide sidebar) and eyes icon (view sidebar).
- **📱 Responsive Design:** Access on any device with adaptive design. Sidebar accessible from app logo and new tasks may be added by clicking "+" sign on mobile view. 
- **🌑 Theme Toggle:** Theme toggle switch on desktop and mobile screens which allows user to switch between light mode and dark mode.
